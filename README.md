#Shake Up

Shake up your night!

Have you ever been waiting at the bar for several minutes just to have the bartender come over and take your drink order? After that you wait several more minutes just to get a drink. With the Shake Up you will not have to wait as long because it is an efficient and unique way to create multiple drinks at the bar.

About:
The system allows bartenders to be able to handle multiple drink orders at once, all by pressing a button. There is a “home base” where you can place the drink mixers on and then the device will automatically mix the drink ingredients together. Bartenders will be able to receive and make multiple drink orders at once so drinks will go out in a timely fashion.
